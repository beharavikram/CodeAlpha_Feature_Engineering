Feature Engineering Task
Overview
This repository contains the feature engineering code and documentation for the [Your Project Name] data science project. Feature engineering is a key step in transforming raw data into meaningful features that enhance the performance of machine learning models.

Purpose
The goal of this task is to prepare and enhance data by creating, transforming, and selecting features that improve the accuracy and efficiency of predictive models. This includes:

Creating New Features: Deriving new variables from existing data.
Transforming Features: Normalizing or scaling data, encoding categorical variables.
Selecting Features: Choosing the most relevant features for modeling.
